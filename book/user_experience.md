# Solution Design/ User Experience


After you have talked to enough people to feel confident about the scope of the problem, combine your original hypothesis with customer feedback to create a modified solution that meets your customer’s needs.
* What have you learned about the problem your target customers are facing?
* What have you learned about your hypothesized solution? Did you modify it in some way to better meet customer needs?

Provide a detailed description of your product or service and the user’s experience
* How and where will people first discover your product/service?
* Is there an on boarding or purchasing process? Please describe.
* How does the product work? Provide a set by step description of the most common use case.
* What ongoing service will you provide for customers once they are on board?
