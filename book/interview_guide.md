# Target Customer Interview Guide

Target Customer Interview Guide
 
The target customer interviews should  help you understand how your customer thinks about the problem and how they perceive your proposed solution.

* Define target group: Who is your customer? Determine the criteria that define your expected customer /user (age, location, interests, income, etc.)
* Find at least 10 people who belong to that target group
* Conduct interviews and ask two sets of questions. One about the problem you claim to solve. The other about your product/service as a solution to this problem. 
* Develop a very early stage prototype, it can be made out of paper and duct tape, anything to put in front of a potential customer to get feedback
 
###First ask about the problem: 
How does the customer define the activity or problem? Note: Don’t describe your solution. Focus on the customer's view of the problem with questions like:
* Do you have problem X?
* How do you currently solve it?
* What do you use in terms of products or services in this activity right now?
* Where or from whom do you buy products or services? What is good about this channel? What is not good?
* How satisfied are you with your current products or services for this activity?
* What is your greatest dissatisfaction with your current products or services?
* Who is responsible for the buying decision? Is it you or someone else?
* What are the criteria that are used for evaluating alternatives?
* How much do you spend each month or year on these types of products or services?
* Would you accept an alternative solution? Why or why not?
* What would be the ideal solution for you and how would you measure its value to you?
 
###Present solution and collect feedback:
* At this point you can describe your solution. Be sure to share the full details of the user experience and validate each step of the process i.e. onboarding, set up, any and all user input that is required, how ongoing service will be delivered etc.
* Ask specific questions such as:
    * Would you…?
        * Use my product/service? Why or why not?
        *  How much and when?
        *  Pay for it? How much?
    *  What fears would you have in trying this solution?
    *  Who would be the ideal supplier? / Where would you want to buy it?
