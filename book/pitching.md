# Solution Design

Once you are confident with your customer interviews, solution and market research submit this [form](https://www.tfaforms.com/389017). This may take up to a week. 


## Pitch
To move from Ready into the Set stage you need to complete a Solution Design pitch. Start preparing a presentation that should include the following:
* Your original Value Proposition
* A **detailed account** of your Target Customer Interviews
* Your Solution Design including your user experience and most common use case
* Market Research including: Target Market, Competition, Ecosystem

Bring your presentation to your first meeting with your coach to review. 



To arrange a Solution Design pitch with the IDEA Staff please have your coach email IDEA Operations Lead, Evan Sutherland. He will work to find a time that works for everyone within the next two weeks. Following the pitch, you will either a) pass into the Set Stage or b) be given detailed feedback and questions to answer in order to pass after an additional Solution Design pitch.
