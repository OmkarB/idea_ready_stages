# Market Research

Now that you have an initial solution design you will need to understand how your product/service is different from what already exists in the market. You will also need to gather details on what it will take to build and service the product. You should be researching three main categories:

###Target Market 
* What market segment are you going after?
* What is the annual revenue of the segment?
* What is the growth rate of the segment?

### Competitive Positioning
* Who are your competitors?
* What is your competitive advantage?
* How do you add value that others do not?

###The Ecosystem
* What does it take to build your product?
* Who will be your suppliers/partners/buyers?
* Who will be using your product?
* What does the distribution channel look like?
