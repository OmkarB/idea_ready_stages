Value Proposition
To prepare for your first session of office hours work on developing your Value Proposition. This is a short positioning statement that explains what benefit you provide for who and how you do it well. It will serve as a hypothesis as you advance through the Ready stage. 
* I solve problem X: Define the activity or problem
* For people who are: Describe your prospective target customers
* By providing: This is your solution, product, or service
* Bring your value proposition to your first session of coaching office hours.
