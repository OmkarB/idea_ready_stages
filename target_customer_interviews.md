# Target Customer Interviews

Target Customer Interviews
At office hours you will talk to a coach about your Value Proposition and begin developing your customer interviews. These interviews are to validate the assumptions you made in your Value Proposition by testing them with real world customers. Be sure that you gain an understanding of both the problem customers are facing and their honest opinion of the proposed solution.

After youâ€™ve had a chance to talk with some customers and process their feedback come back to office hours to work through the design of your solution.
