#IDEA

Welcome to IDEA, Northeastern Universityâ€™s Venture Accelerator! Our mission is to help you reach your entrepreneurial potential by providing the support, curriculum and resources you need to develop your concept into a business. You will work through a well thought out curriculum that is comprised of three stages: Ready, Set and Go. Each stage will focus on a different area to help you and your team develop your business.

At every stage, motivated and experienced individuals will be available to support you as you start building your company. Best of all, everything is self-paced, you will be able to work through the stages at whatever speed you need.
